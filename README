# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In this project I made a daily planner for a general workday from 9-5 to manage my time wisely and time effectively.

### Tasks Completed

To complete this task I made hourly time blocks from 9-5 that changes colors to indicate past, present, or future. In each hour I added a save button to save information inputted in each hourly time block which also is saved to local storage.
